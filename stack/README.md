# Stack Implementation in Ruby

This project contains a custom implementation of a **stack** data structure in Ruby — built *without* using Ruby's built-in `push` and `pop` methods.

It includes a demo program that reverses a string using the stack.

## Files

- `stack.rb` — Custom Stack class with `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty?`
- `reverse_string.rb` — Small script that asks for user input and prints the reversed string using the stack

##  Why This?

This is part of my journey to understand data structures **from the ground up** using my favorite language: Ruby.

I'm building each one manually — no shortcuts — to truly learn how they work under the hood.

##  What's Next?

- [ ] Implement a Queue
- [ ] Add `undo` functionality demo
- [ ] Build a balanced parentheses checker
